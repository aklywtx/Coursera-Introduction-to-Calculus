# Coursera-Introduction-to-Calculus
This course contains three parts: pre calculus knowledge, differential calculus and integral calculus. Each video is accompanied by a note and a quiz. This course is perfect for beginners or anyone who wants to brush up on mathematics.  

I particularly enjoyed the classical music (maybe Bach) that is played at the beginning and end of each video.
